 * Interface offered by the SUT-specific adapter part (part that interacts with SUT).

 * <li>a SUT-specific part: interacts with the SUT, implements this interface

 * The TorX-specific adapter part uses an implementation of this interface
 * to (try to) apply stimuli to the system under test, and an implementation of this
 * interface will typically use the enqueueObservation function of the TorXConnector
 * interface to report observations.
